ASCIIart support
----------------
This fork has a support for [ASCIIart (link to wikipedia)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII_art) for you use the image files in native format (jpg, pngâ€¦) and the game shows a pretty ASCIIart.

It is very easy to use.

```javascript
var image = new ROT.Image();

image.strResolution = "medium";
image.bBlock = false;
image.load("combat.png");

var display = new ROT.Display({width:w, height:h, fontSize:10});

image.paint(display, 0, 0);
```

The image methods are:
* load(url): get a image from url and convert to ASCIIart.
* blit(display, display_x, display_y, image_x, image_y, rect_w, rect_h): paint a part of ASCIIart into the display.
* paint(display, offset_x, offset_y): paint the entire ASCIIart into a position in the display.

And the config attributes are:
* bBlock: for to paint blocks instead characters.
* bColor: ASCIIart in color or not.
* strResolution: (low, medium, high) the ASCII art resolution.
